Important context about MCP servers:
- When asked about "MCP servers" or "how many MCP servers", you should use the get_mcp_server_info tool to check the configured MCP servers in the codebase
- MCP servers are configuration entities defined in the code, not database records
- Only query databases for MCP-related data if explicitly asked about database-stored MCP information"""
